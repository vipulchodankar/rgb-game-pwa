# RGB Color Game

What is RGB? RGB stands for “Red Green Blue” and is an additive color model in which red, green and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue.

To form a color with RGB, three light beams (one red, one green, and one blue) must be combined. Each of the three beams is called a component of that color, and each of them can have an arbitrary intensity, from fully off – 0 to fully on – 255, in the mixture.

For example:
RGB(0, 0, 0) would be black – zero color intensity of each component.
RGB(255, 255, 255) would be white – full-color intensity of each component.
RGB(255, 0, 0) would be red – full red intensity and zero green and blue.
RGB(255, 255, 0) would be a combination of red and green – yellow
And so on, the values of each component, going from 0 to 255 together form a color.
